# How to Play Simon Says Game
The game will flash a sequence of lights at you. 
Your job is to click the correct buttons that match with the corresponding sequence.
Each time you correctly click the correct sequence of buttons, you will go to the next level which has another button added to the sequence.
For example, the game starts by flashing a single button at you. 
If you press the correct button, you will level up and the game will now flash that first button and another one.
If you press the wrong button that doesn't match the sequence, the game will end.
If you lose, you will receive the length of your last correctly answered sequence as your score.
